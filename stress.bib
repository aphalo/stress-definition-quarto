However, recent evidence demonstrates that plants can discriminately allocate more resources to roots that develop in patches with increasing nutrient levels, even when their other roots develop in richer patches. Responsiveness to the direction and steepness of spatial and temporal trajectories of environmental variables might enable plants to increase their performance by improving their readiness to anticipated resource availabilities in their immediate proximity. Exploring the ecological implications and mechanisms of trajectory- sensitivity in plants is expected to shed new light on the ways plants learn their environment and anticipate its future challenges and opportunities.},

Plant-produced volatile compounds mediate various aspects of plant defence. The emission of volatiles has costs and benefits. Research on the role of plant volatiles in defence has focused primarily on the responses of individual plants. However, in nature, plants rarely occur as isolated individuals but are members of plant communities where they compete for resources and exchange information with other plants. In this review, we address the effects of neighbouring plants on plant volatile-mediated defences. We will outline the various roles of volatile compounds in the interactions between plants and other organisms, address the mechanisms of plant neighbour perception in plant communities, and discuss how neighbour detection and volatile signalling are interconnected. Finally, we will outline the most urgent questions to be addressed in the future.},

  abstract  = {Recent evidence demonstrates that plants are able not only to perceive and adaptively respond to external information but also to anticipate forthcoming hazards and stresses. Here, we tested the hypothesis that unstressed plants are able to respond to stress cues emitted from their abiotically-stressed neighbors and in turn induce stress responses in additional unstressed plants located further away from the stressed plants. Pisum sativum plants were subjected to drought while neighboring rows of five unstressed plants on both sides, with which they could exchange different cue combinations. On one side, the stressed plant and its unstressed neighbors did not share their rooting volumes {(UNSHARED)} and thus were limited to shoot communication. On its other side, the stressed plant shared one of its rooting volumes with its nearest unstressed neighbor and all plants shared their rooting volumes with their immediate neighbors {(SHARED),} allowing both root and shoot communication. Fifteen minutes following drought induction, significant stomatal closure was observed in both the stressed plants and their nearest unstressed {SHARED} neighbors, and within one hour, all {SHARED} neighbors closed their stomata. Stomatal closure was not observed in the {UNSHARED} neighbors. The results demonstrate that unstressed plants are able to perceive and respond to stress cues emitted by the roots of their drought-stressed neighbors and, via 'relay cuing', elicit stress responses in further unstressed plants. Further work is underway to study the underlying mechanisms of this new mode of plant communication and its possible adaptive implications for the anticipation of forthcoming abiotic stresses by plants.},

The contribution of the stomata and the chloroplasts to this acclimation is unknown. We evaluated stomatal and chloroplast contributions when soil-grown sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plants were subjected to water deficit pretreatments for 2 weeks. The relationship between photosynthesis and Psi(l), determined from gas-exchange and isopiestic thermocouple psychometry, was shifted 3 to 4 bars towards lower Psi(l), in pretreated plants. Leaf diffusive resistance was similarly affected. Chloroplast activity, demonstrated in situ with measurements of quantum yield and the capacity to fix CO(2) at all partial pressures of CO(2), and in vitro by photosystem II activity of isolated organelles, was inhibited at low Psi(l) but less in pretreated plants than in control plants. The magnitude of this inhibition indicated that decreases in chloroplast activity contributed more than closure of stomata both to losses in photosynthesis and to the acclimation of photosynthesis to low Psi(l).},

  abstract = {The nature of plant behaviour is discussed, and it is concluded that it is best described as what plants do. The possibility that plant behaviour is simply signal-induced phenotypic plasticity is outlined, and some limitations of this assumption are considered. Natural environments present many challenges to growing plants, and the consequent signalling that plants perceive is becoming extremely complex. Plant behaviour is active, purposeful and intentional, and examples are discussed. Much plant behaviour, concerned with stress and herbivory, is also based on an assessment of the future likelihood of further damaging episodes and is therefore predictive. Plant behaviour involves the acquisition and processing of information. Informational terminology provides a suitable way of incorporating the concepts of learning, memory and intelligence into plant behaviour, capabilities that plants are rarely credited with. Finally, trade-offs, cost-benefit assessments and decision making are common plant behavioural attributes. It is suggested that intelligent assessments that involve the whole plant are essential to optimize these adaptive capabilities.},

This response was reduced or abolished when individual internodes were shaded from far-red radiation scattered by surrounding seedlings, demonstrating the operation of a photomorphogenetic control of stem elongation which could be of significance in plant adjustment during the early stage of canopy development.},

  abstract         = {Plants can perceive, integrate and respond to multiple signals and cues informative of imminent threats and opportunities. Here, we tested the hypothesis that unstressed plants are able to perceive and adaptively respond to stress cues emitted from their drought-stressed neighbours, and to induce adaptive responses in additional unstressed plants. Triplets of split-root Stenotaphrum secundatum plants were grown in rows. One root of the first plant was subjected to drought while its other root shared its pot with one of the roots of an unstressed target neighbour, which in turn shared its other pot with an additional unstressed target neighbour. Cuing from drought-stressed plants increased survival in both proximate directly cued and in more distant relayed-cued target plants under drought. Drought cuing lowered plant performance under benign conditions. Experiments with a Wilty mutant and fluridone treatments showed that drought cuing was greatly reduced in {ABA}-deficient Pisum Sativum plants. Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the possible adaptive implications of both direct and relayed stress cuing among neighbouring plants, the possible cost of plant responsiveness to drought cues under benign conditions and the involvement of {ABA} in interplant drought cuing. The results suggest that interplant root communication of drought cues could have novel implications for plant interactions, survival and performance under both natural and agricultural settings.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that architectural plasticity in shoot size and number allows plants to manage environmental risks. Simpler structures require shorter development times and fewer resources, which secure minimal fitness even under risky and unfavourable conditions. Here we tested the hypothesis that the magnitude of such architectural plasticity depends on the species' developmental strategy. Specifically, species with late reproduction were expected to express the highest levels of architectural plasticity in response to environmental cues predicting high probability of abrupt deterioration in growth conditions. This hypothesis was tested by comparing Mediterranean and semi-arid populations of three species, which differed in growth strategy: Trifolium purpureum, a determinate and late flowerer, and Emex spinosa and Hippocrepis unisiliquosa that flower indeterminately throughout the season. All plants were exposed to varying levels of water availability and competition, but only T.~purpureum displayed plastic architectural responsiveness to the experimental manipulations. In contrast, the early and extended step-by-step flowering of both E.~spinosa and H.~unisiliquosa reflected a relatively deterministic bet-hedging reproductive schedule, whereby minimum fitness is secured even under adverse conditions. These two opposing strategies gave contrasting results, with E.~spinosa and H.~unisiliquosa displaying reduced efficiency under favourable conditions under which T.~purpureum had the highest reproductive efficiency. The evolutionary interplay between deterministic risk-averse and plastic risk-prone growth strategies might reflect contrasts in the probability and severity of environmental risks, and the costs of missed opportunities.},
